Welcome to my website.  

I am a senior at St. Olaf College. I major in Math and Computer Science, and concentrate in Statistics and Data Science.  

I love working collaboratively to help people solve data-driven problems!  

This website is a work in progress and a learning project.  

Check out one of my recent projects, a Principal-Components Analysis of UFC Fighters and their styles [here](/pdfs/final.html)!
