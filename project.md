__UFC Fighter PCA and Clustering Analysis__  
Final Project for Algorithms for Decision Making (Intro to Machine Learning)  
Summary: Scraped data on ~3000 fighters from [UfcStats.com](http://ufcstats.com/statistics/fighters), performed principal component analysis, and then compared k-means and hierarchical clustering.  
Submission: [UFC_Analysis](/pdfs/final.html)  

[__Polygon Visibility Algorithm__](https://math282.spencereanes.org)  
Final Project for Computational Geometry
