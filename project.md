__Factors Controlling Coral Skeletal U/Ca Ratios with Implications for their Use as a Proxy for Past Ocean Conditions__  
Group Members: Spencer Eanes, Emily Patterson, Penelope Lancrete  
Advisors: [Anne Gothmann](https://gothma1.wixsite.com/annemgothmann), Paul Roback  
Summary: Year long research project through St. Olaf's Center for Interdisciplinary Research. This project is a statistical analysis of fossilized coral and it's implications as a proxy for past ocean conditions. An early version of this paper won 1st Prize in the [US Undegraduate Statistics Research Project competition](https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/usresp/2020/spring/winners). The paper is in review for publication with the American Journal of Undergraduate Research.
